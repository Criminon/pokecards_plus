# Pocket Crystal League +
### A mod by Hyperion_21

THIS IS NOT CREATED BY THE ORIGINAL GAME'S CREATOR NOR THE POKEMON COMPANY! THIS IS A MOD OF A FANGAME! FIND THE ORIGINAL GAME [HERE](https://moodytail.itch.io/pocket-crystal-league)! ALL CREDIT TO THEM!

Adds (in the final version) Pokemon from all 7 generations.

Not finished... but we'll get there eventually. Right now, this mod is in an extremely early state, and is not meant to be played on. Be warned.

And yes, I know the starter decks are extremely glitchy right now (missingno's and off-screen cards). For now, just click the collect-all button on the bottom right to get past that screen.


To build this mod:
- Clone the repo onto your computer
- Open it up in gamemaker studio
- Build it (or just run it; turns out you need to pay for gamemaker to create desktop binaries... so unless you have paid gamemaker you pretty much have to debug the game to play it)

(note to self: attach binaries later)

Adds (in the final version) Pokemon from all 7 generations.

Currently only adds a few dozen pokemon out of hundreds... but we'll get there eventually. Right now, this mod is in an extremely early state, and is not meant to be played on. Be warned.

And yes, I know the starter decks are extremely glitchy right now (missingno's and off-screen cards). For now, just click the collect-all button on the bottom right to get past that screen.


To build this game:
- Clone the repo onto your computer
- Open it up in gamemaker studio
- Build it (or just run it)

(note to self: attach binaries later)

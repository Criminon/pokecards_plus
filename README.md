# Pocket Crystal League +
### A mod by Hyperion_21 (with help of DarkAnarchist and Tukurai)

THIS IS NOT CREATED BY THE ORIGINAL GAME'S CREATOR NOR THE POKEMON COMPANY! THIS IS A MOD OF A FANGAME! FIND THE ORIGINAL GAME [HERE](https://moodytail.itch.io/pocket-crystal-league)! ALL CREDIT TO THEM!

Adds Pokemon from all 7 generations.

ALL POKEMON ARE ADDED! We just need to balance them...

To build this mod:
- Clone the repo onto your computer
- Open it up in gamemaker studio
- Build it (or just run it; turns out you need to pay for gamemaker to create desktop binaries... so unless you have paid gamemaker you pretty much have to debug the mod to play it)

(note to self: attach binaries later)
